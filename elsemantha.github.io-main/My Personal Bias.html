    <h4> Sophia </h3>
    <img src="Sophia.jpg"alt="An image of Sophia."width="300px">
    <p> Sophia is my top bias because not only is she pretty and talented, but she is also an incredibly responsible person. </p>
    <h4> Megan </h3>
    <img src="Megan.jpg"alt="An image of Megan."width="300px">
    <p> Megan is my second bias because shes pretty and very talented, she is also a very silly person, shes funny and could also relate to fans. </p>
